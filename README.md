# SimpleSimulator
A simple simulation tool for math&physics equations using MVVM architecture. 

## Disclaimer

This project is still WIP. An MVP of the solution will be done after the following implementations: 

## 0.1.0 Features

- Core Features & UI 
    - Create a main screen where users can select between different simulations.
    - List available simulations dynamically (e.g., Projectile Motion, future physics simulations).
    - Ensure navigation between the main screen and simulation screen works smoothly.
- Improve Simulation UI/UX
    - Improve the layout of the simulation screen.
- Application Testing
    - Increase the test coverage to an initial of 70%.
    - Test on Windows (native .exe) and Linux (via .NET Runtime).
- Deployment & Versioning
    - Update README.md with instructions. 
    - Add a CHANGELOG.md to track version changes. 
    - Create a GitHub release for Windows and Linux (for v0.1.0)
